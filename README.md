## Low Credits Notification

The email notification for low credits is not a traditional email, but rather an Odoo activity that appears in the admin's activity stream. This is configured in your module as follows:

- When your GatewayAPI credits fall below the minimum threshold, the system triggers the server action `model_iap_account_action_low_tokens`.
- This action creates a To-Do activity for the admin user with:
  - **Summary:** "GatewayAPI low on credits"
  - **Note:** "Buy more SMS credits with provider GatewayAPI"

**What the notification looks like:**
- The admin will see a new activity in the Odoo chatter (and in their activity dashboard) with the above summary and note.
- The activity is not a direct email, but Odoo can be configured to send email reminders for pending activities, so the admin may receive an email with the same content if reminders are enabled.
