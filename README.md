### Important Notes for Odoo 17

In Odoo 17, the SMS provider system has been simplified, but GatewayAPI will still work correctly with this module. When you configure an account with GatewayAPI settings (API token and base URL), the module will automatically:

1. Recognize it as a GatewayAPI-enabled account (shown with blue highlight in the list)
2. Use it for sending SMS instead of the default Odoo SMS gateway
3. Enable all GatewayAPI features like balance monitoring and notifications

You can view all GatewayAPI accounts directly by going to **Settings > Technical > GatewayAPI SMS Accounts**.

## Usage

- Send SMS from Odoo using the GatewayAPI provider.
- Receive admin notifications when your credit balance drops below your set threshold.
- All configuration and scheduling is managed from the IAP Account formâ€”no need to edit Scheduled Actions manually.

### Example: Low Credits Notification Activity

This is what the admin will see in the Odoo activity stream when credits fall below the minimum threshold:

## Low Credits Notification

The email notification for low credits is not a traditional email, but rather an Odoo activity that appears in the admin's activity stream. This is configured in your module as follows:

- When your GatewayAPI credits fall below the minimum threshold, the system triggers the server action `model_iap_account_action_low_tokens`.
- This action creates a To-Do activity for the admin user with:
  - **Summary:** "GatewayAPI low on credits"
  - **Note:** "Buy more SMS credits with provider GatewayAPI"

**What the notification looks like:**
- The admin will see a new activity in the Odoo chatter (and in their activity dashboard) with the above summary and note.
- The activity is not a direct email, but Odoo can be configured to send email reminders for pending activities, so the admin may receive an email with the same content if reminders are enabled.

## Troubleshooting

### The "GatewayAPI" provider option doesn't appear in selection field

After installation, you should see "GatewayAPI" as an option in the provider selection field.
If this doesn't appear, try the following steps:

1. Run the provider field fix script:
   ```
   python odoo-bin shell -c /path/to/odoo.conf -d your_database
   >>> exec(open('/path/to/addons/gatewayapi_sms/scripts/fix_provider_field.py').read())
   ```

2. Update the module:
   ```
   python odoo-bin -c /path/to/odoo.conf -d your_database -u gatewayapi_sms
   ```

3. Restart the Odoo server

### Configuration Testing

If you want to test your GatewayAPI configuration, you can use the diagnostic script:
```
python odoo-bin shell -c /path/to/odoo.conf -d your_database
>>> exec(open('/path/to/addons/gatewayapi_sms/scripts/check_provider_selection.py').read())
```
