# GatewayAPI Notification Action Fix

## Issue Description

When the "Check for minimum credits" checkbox was enabled in the IAP Account configuration for GatewayAPI, the following error message appeared in the logs:

```
odoo.addons.gatewayapi_sms.models.iap_account: GatewayAPI notification action not set. Skipping balance check.
```

This occurred because the system was not automatically setting the notification action when the checkbox was enabled.

## Fix Implementation

The following changes were made to fix this issue:

1. Modified the `write` method in the `IapAccount` model to automatically set the `gatewayapi_token_notification_action` field when the `gatewayapi_check_min_tokens` field is set to `True`.

```python
# If check_min_tokens is enabled, schedule a run at the next possible time
# and set the notification action if not already set
if vals.get('gatewayapi_check_min_tokens'):
    self._schedule_next_credit_check()
    
    # Set the notification action if it's not already set
    for record in self:
        if not record.gatewayapi_token_notification_action:
            try:
                notification_action = self.env.ref('gatewayapi_sms.low_credits_notification_action')
                record.gatewayapi_token_notification_action = notification_action.id
                _logger.info("Set notification action for account %s", record.id)
            except Exception as e:
                _logger.error("Failed to set notification action: %s", e)
```

2. Added the `gatewayapi_token_notification_action` field to the form view in `views/iap_account.xml` to make it visible and editable in the UI.

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Using the Test Script

A test script has been provided to verify that the notification action is properly set when the "Check for minimum credits" checkbox is enabled.

1. Run the Odoo shell:

```bash
odoo shell -d your_database -c your_config_file --no-http
```

2. In the shell, execute the test script:

```python
exec(open('/path/to/gatewayapi_sms/scripts/test_notification_action.py').read())
```

The script will:
- Find a GatewayAPI account
- Enable the "Check for minimum credits" checkbox
- Check if the notification action was automatically set
- If not, set it manually
- Test the credit balance check

### Option 2: Manual Testing

1. Go to Settings > Technical > IAP Accounts
2. Find or create a GatewayAPI account
3. Enable the "Check for minimum credits" checkbox
4. Save the account
5. Verify that the "Credits notification action" field is automatically set to "Send GatewayAPI Low Credits Notification"
6. Check the logs to ensure that the error message no longer appears

## Additional Notes

- The notification action is defined in `data/iap_account_data.xml` as `low_credits_notification_action`
- The cron job that runs the credit balance check is defined in `data/ir_cron.xml` as `ir_cron_check_tokens`
- The notification action sends a message to the notification channel and creates an activity for the admin user
