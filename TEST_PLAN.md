# GatewayAPI SMS Connector Test Plan for Odoo 17

This document outlines steps to test and verify the GatewayAPI SMS module functionality in Odoo 17.

## Prerequisites

1. A valid GatewayAPI account with API token.
2. Odoo 17 installation with the module installed.
3. Admin access to Odoo.

## Test Procedure

### 1. Configuration Tests

1. **Access GatewayAPI Settings**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Technical â†’ GatewayAPI SMS Accounts.
   - Verify the GatewayAPI accounts list view appears.
   - Click "Create GatewayAPI Account" to create a new account.

2. **Configure GatewayAPI Account**
   - Fill in the following fields:
     - Name: GatewayAPI
     - Service Name: sms (must be exactly this value)
     - GatewayAPI Base URL: <https://gatewayapi.eu> or <https://gatewayapi.com>
     - Sender Name: Your preferred sender name
     - API Token: Your GatewayAPI API token
   - Click the "Test Connection" button.
   - Verify "Connection status" shows "OK".
   - Verify the Balance field shows your current credit balance.
   - Note that the account is automatically marked as a GatewayAPI account (shown in blue in the list).

3. **Configure Notification Settings**
   - Enable "Check for minimum credits".
   - Set "Minimum credits" to a value higher than your current balance for testing.
   - Set the check interval to something small (e.g., 5 minutes) for testing.
   - Save the account.

### 2. Functional Tests

1. **Send Test SMS**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Technical â†’ SMS Marketing â†’ SMS.
   - Create a new SMS message.
   - Enter a valid phone number in E.164 format (e.g., +4712345678).
   - Enter a test message.
   - Click Send.
   - Verify the SMS status changes to "Sent".
   - Check the recipient phone to confirm receipt.

2. **Test Emoji Handling**
   - Create another SMS with emojis in the message (e.g., "Hello ðŸ‘‹ from Odoo ðŸ˜Š").
   - Send to a valid number.
   - Verify the SMS is received with emojis intact.

3. **Credit Check Test**
   - Wait for the scheduled credit check to run (or trigger manually in debug mode).
   - Verify you receive a notification about low credits.
   - Check the Activities dashboard for the notification.

### 3. Diagnostic Tests

1. **Run Diagnostic Script**
   - Access the Odoo shell:

     ```bash
     python odoo-bin shell -c /path/to/odoo.conf -d your_database --addons-path=/path/to/addons
     ```

   - Execute:

     ```python
     exec(open('scripts/check_gatewayapi_config.py').read())
     ```

   - Verify the output shows correct configuration values.
   - Verify the balance is displayed correctly.

2. **Test Webhook Configuration with JWT**
   - This test verifies your Odoo instance's ability to receive and process GatewayAPI webhooks, including JWT authentication.
   - **Prerequisites**:
     - Ensure the `gatewayapi.webhook_jwt_secret` system parameter is set in Odoo (Settings > Technical > Parameters > System Parameters).
     - Install required Python packages: `pip install requests pyjwt`
   - **Usage**:
     - Navigate to the module's script directory in your terminal:

       ```bash
       cd /path/to/your/odoo/custom_addons/gatewayapi_sms/scripts
       ```

     - Set the following environment variables (replace placeholders):

       ```bash
       export ODOO_URL="https://your_odoo_domain.com" # e.g., example.com or localhost:8069
       export ODOO_DB="your_database_name"        # Your Odoo database name
       export ODOO_USER="your_admin_username"     # An Odoo user with API access (e.g., admin)
       export ODOO_API_KEY='YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY' # Generate an API key for ODOO_USER in Odoo (My Profile -> Account Security -> API Keys)
       unset ODOO_PASSWORD                        # Recommended: Unset password if using API key
       export VERIFY_SSL="true"                    # Set to "true" or "false" based on your SSL certificate setup
       ```

       *Note: If your Odoo user has 2FA enabled, using an API Key (`ODOO_API_KEY`) is highly recommended as the script does not support 2FA codes directly.*
     - Run the script:

       ```bash
       python3 test_webhook_config.py
       ```

   - **Expected Output**:
     - The script will provide detailed logs, including:
       - Confirmation of successful authentication with Odoo.
       - Whether the JWT secret is found and correctly configured.
       - The `iat` (issued at) and `exp` (expires at) timestamps embedded in the test JWT token.
       - The HTTP status (e.g., 200 OK, 401 Unauthorized) of the simulated webhook call to your Odoo instance.
     - A successful run will show messages indicating that the JWT secret is configured and the webhook test was successful with a `200 OK` response from Odoo.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     - If you encounter a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` error, double-check your `gatewayapi.webhook_jwt_secret` value in Odoo and ensure it matches the secret configured in GatewayAPI.
     - `Token has expired` errors suggest a time synchronization issue between your server and GatewayAPI or an incorrect token expiry setting. The script extends expiry to 24 hours to mitigate this for testing.
     - `Failed to search system parameters: 404` or similar login errors indicate incorrect Odoo URL, DB, username, or API Key. Ensure `ODOO_URL` includes the full scheme (e.g., `https://`).
     - If using a self-signed SSL certificate, set `VERIFY_SSL="false"`.

3. **Run Account Fix Script (Advanced Diagnostics)**
   - The `scripts/fix_provider_field.py` (previously may have been referred to as `fix_gatewayapi_accounts.py`) is generally no longer needed for initial setup, as the provider field should set automatically when GatewayAPI URL and Token are entered.
   - This script is retained for:
     - Advanced diagnostics of persistent configuration problems.
     - Fixing data integrity issues on existing accounts (e.g., ensuring `service_name` is 'sms').
     - Use with older, unpatched versions of the module.
   - Before running, ensure your module is up-to-date. The script itself contains a warning about its use.
   - If, after ensuring your system is up-to-date and credentials are correctly entered, you still suspect an issue that this script might address:

     ```python
     exec(open('scripts/fix_provider_field.py').read())
     ```

   - The script attempts to ensure that accounts with GatewayAPI credentials are correctly marked with the 'sms_api_gatewayapi' provider and have `service_name` set to 'sms'.
   - Verify its output for any actions taken or accounts checked.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify the API token is correct.
   - Check internet connectivity.
   - Confirm the GatewayAPI service is operational.

2. **SMS Not Sending**
   - Check the IAP account balance.
   - Verify the phone number format (must be E.164, e.g., +4512345678).
   - Check error messages in the SMS record.
   - Enable debug/developer mode to see detailed errors.

3. **Balance Not Showing**
   - Verify the API token.
   - Check if `service_name` is set to "sms".
   - Verify the base URL is correct.

4. **GatewayAPI Not Being Used**
   - Verify the `is_gatewayapi` field is True (or the account is highlighted in blue in the list view) for your account after entering credentials.
   - If the provider field did not set automatically, first check the module version, Odoo logs, and ensure correct credential entry.
   - The `fix_provider_field.py` script can be used as a last resort for older versions or complex data issues to ensure the provider and service_name are correctly set.
   - Ensure at least one account has both `gatewayapi_base_url` and `gatewayapi_api_token` set for GatewayAPI functionality.

## Expected Results

- GatewayAPI account properly connects to the API.
- SMS messages are successfully sent.
- Special characters and emojis are handled correctly.
- Credit notifications are displayed when credits are low.
