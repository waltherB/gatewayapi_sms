### 3. Diagnostic Tests

1. **Run Diagnostic Script**

     ```

     ```
   - Verify output shows correct configuration values
   - Verify balance is displayed correctly

2. **Run Account Fix Script if Needed**
   - If you encounter issues with GatewayAPI not being selected:
     ```python
     exec(open('scripts/fix_gatewayapi_accounts.py').read())
     ```
   - This will check all accounts, fix any configuration issues, and create a default GatewayAPI account if none exists
   - Verify the script output shows that at least one GatewayAPI account is available
